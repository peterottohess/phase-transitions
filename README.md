# phase-transitions
MATEMATICA files and C++ routines, papar on phase transitions
The MATEMATICA files refer directly to the figures in their names.
In Fig8-11.nb the calculations for n=4 are presented. For n=3
one has to change the corresponding parameter values
(e.g., B=64/27 for n=3 and 81/8 for n=4) and formulas
for the potential and the equation for critical points,
which can be retrieved from the manuscript (manuscript.pdf).
Also the rotational parameter a (in the Kerr metric) can
be changed to the value desired.
